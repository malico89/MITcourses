PDF files include problem statements (source: https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-0002-introduction-to-computational-thinking-and-data-science-fall-2016/assignments/).

PSET1, Knapsack:
  * PS1A: loading cows for trips, aka knapsack problem. Implemented as greedy and brute force.
  * PS1_cow_data are different cow names/weights to test with code.
  * PS1_partition supports brute force implementation by generating all permutations of cows.
  * PS1B: Knapsack with dynamic programming to solve a version of the optimal coin change problem. Using bottom-up tabulation method.
